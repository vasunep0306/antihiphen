A way to get rid of blanks. I can add whatever I want for as long as I want and it will get rid of blanks.  I decided to make a repo for this because it took me forever to figure out how to do it. So I have resorted to making a repo.
#to use
just clone it and run it.  I am assuming you have python3 installed and know how to code in python(or really any language) 100%.
